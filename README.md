## Motivation
I wanted to have an easier way of planning my days. I know myself, and I always misplace things. A physical planner would be with me for a month at best before being lost. My computer, on the other hand, always stays in one spot. It's quick and convenient, as I'm already here doing my work anyways. It makes for a one stop shop in a way. Saving also means I get to remember less and do more!

It's as easy as clicking a times text area and typing whatever needs to be done. Afterwards, you'll want to make sure to click the save button!! If you don't you'll lose whatever you've typed in! You'll also need to click separately for each hour. Then, on page refresh or reload, all of your tasks will be loaded and populated where they need to be!
